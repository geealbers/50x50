Modern France was the main centre for the European art of the Upper Paleolithic, then left many megalithic monuments, and in the Iron Age many of the most impressive finds of early Celtic art. The Gallo-Roman period left a distinctive provincial style of sculpture, and the region around the modern Franco-German border led the empire in the mass production of finely decoratedAncient Roman pottery, which was exported to Italy and elsewhere on a lagre scale. With Merovingian art the story of French styles as a distinct and influential element in the wider development of the art of Christian Europe begins. (Citation: Faure 1909, 54Faure, Élie. Histoire de l’Art. Vol. 1, L’Art antique. Paris: Gallimard, 1909)\nFrance can fairly be said to have been a leader in the development of Romanesque art and Gothic art, before the Italian Renaissance led to Italy replacing France as the main source of stylistic developments until the age of Louis XIV, when France largely regained this role, holding it until the mid-20th century.\nContents  Early Modern Period  Baroque and Classicism Rococo and Neoclassicism  Modern Period  19th Century 20th Century   Early Modern Period In the late fifteenth century, the French invasion of Italy and the proximity of the vibrant Burgundy court, with its Flemish connections, brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the Northern and Italian Renaissance. Initial artistic changes at that time in France were executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as Jean Clouet and his son François Clouet, along with the Italians, Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio, and Niccolò dell\u0026rsquo;Abbate of what is often called the first School of Fontainebleau from 1531. Leonardo da Vinci also was invited to France by François I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced little for the French king. (Citation: Rosenblum 1967, 103Rosenblum, Robert. Transformations in Late Eighteenth-Century Art. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1967.)\nThe art of the period from François I through Henri IV often is heavily inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as Mannerism, which is associated with Michelangelo and Parmigianino, among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual rhetoric, including the elaborate use of allegory and mythology. (Citation: Rosen and Zerner 1984Rosen, Charles, and Henry Zerner. Romanticism and Realism. The Mythology of Nineteenth-Century Art. New York: Viking, 1984.) Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the Châteaux of the Loire Valley. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.\nBaroque and Classicism  The seventeenth century marked a golden age for French art in all fields. In the early part of the seventeenth century, late mannerist and early Baroque tendencies continued to flourish in the court of Marie de Medici and Louis XIII. Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of Peter Paul Rubens with his the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to Nicolas Poussin with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicism. Another proponent of classicism working in Rome was Claude Gellée, known as Le Lorrain, who defined the form of classical landscape.\nVIDEO COURTESY OF MASTER AND MASTERWORKS PRODUCTION, INC.    Many young French painters of the beginning of the century went to Rome to train themselves and soon assimilated Caravaggio\u0026rsquo;s influence like Valentin de Boulogne and Simon Vouet. The later is credited with bringing the baroque in France and at his return in Paris in 1627 he was named first painter of the king. But French painting soon departed from the extravagance and naturalism of the Italian baroque and painters like Eustache Le Sueur and Laurent de La Hyre, following Poussin example developed a classicist way known as \u0026ldquo;Parisian atticism\u0026rdquo;, inspired by Antiquity, and focusing on proportion, harmony and the importance of drawing. Even Vouet, after his return from Italy, changed his manner to a more measured but still highly decorative and elegant style.\nBut at the same time there was still a strong Caravaggisti school represented in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour. The wretched and the poor were featured in a quasi-Dutch manner in the paintings by the three Le Nain brothers. In the paintings of Philippe de Champaigne there are both propagandistic portraits of Louis XIII\u0026rsquo; s minister Cardinal Richelieu and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic Jansenist sect. In architecture, architects like Salomon de Brosse, François Mansart and Jacques Lemercier helped define the French form of the baroque, developing the formula of the urban hôtel particulier that was to influence all of Europe and strongly departed from the Italian equivalent, the palazzo. Many aristocratic castles were rebuilt in the new classic- baroque style, some of the most famous being Maisons and Cheverny, characterized by high roofs \u0026ldquo;à la française\u0026rdquo; and a form that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers.\nFrom the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to by the term \u0026ldquo;Classicism\u0026rdquo; which implies an adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in southern and eastern Europe during the same period. Under Louis XIV, the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as Bernini\u0026rsquo;s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV. Georges de La Tour, The Penitent Magdalene, c. 1640. (Citation: Berson 1996, 233Berson, Ruth, ed. The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874–1886; Documentation. 2 vols. San Francisco: Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996.)\n  This group caption supercedes individual captions.   Through propaganda, wars, and great architectural works, Louis XIV launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The Palace of Versailles, initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties, under the direction of architects Louis Le Vau (who had also built the château de Vaux-le-Vicomte) and Jules Hardouin Mansart (who built the church of the Invalides in Paris), painter and designer Charles Le Brun, and the landscape architect André Le Nôtre who perfected the rational form of the French garden that from Versailles spread in all of Europe.\nFor sculpture Louis XIV\u0026rsquo;s reign also proved an important moment thanks to the King\u0026rsquo;s protection of artists like Pierre Puget, François Girardon and Charles-Antoine Coysevox. In Rome, Pierre Legros, working in a more baroque manner, was one of the most influential sculptors of the end of the century.\nRococo and Neoclassicism Rococo and Neoclassicism are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the late seventeenth to the late eighteenth centuries. In France, the death ofLouis XIV in 1715 lead to a period of freedom commonly called the Régence. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the young king Louis XV and the government led by the duke of Orléans residing in Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as rocaille : the asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters subjects, like the \u0026ldquo;fêtes galantes\u0026rdquo;, theater settings, pleasant mythological narratives and the female nude. Most of the times the moralising sides of myths or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very colorful scenes. Important painters from this period include Antoine Watteau, considered the inventor of thefête galante, Nicolas Lancret and François Boucher.\nT.B.D    The Louis XV style of decoration, although already apparent at the end of the last reign, was lighter with pastel colors, wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding, and fewer brocades; shells, garlands, and occasional Chinese subjects predominated. The Chantilly, Vincennes and then Sèvres manufactures produced some of the finest porcelain of the time. The highly skilled ébénistes, cabinet-makers mostly based in Paris, created elaborate pieces of furniture with precious wood and bronze ornaments that were to be highly praised and imitated in all of Europe. The most famous are Jean-François Oeben, who created the work desk of king Louis XV in Versailles, and Bernard II van Risamburgh. Rooms in châteaux and hôtels particuliers were more intimate than during the reign of Louis XIV and were decorated with rocaille style boiseries (carved wood pannels covering the walls of a room) conceived by architects like Germain Boffrand or ornemanistes (designers of decorative objects) likeJuste-Aurèle Meissonnier.\nThe most prominent architects of the first half of the century were, apart Boffrand, Robert de Cotte and Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who designed public squares like theplace de la Concordein Paris and the place de la Bourse in Bordeaux in a style consciously inspired by that of the era of Louis XIV. During the first half of the century, France replaced Italy as the artistic centre and main artistic influence in Europe and many French artists worked in other courts across the continent.\nThe latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the French language was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, genre painting, landscape, portrait, and still life were extremely fashionable. Chardin and Jean-Baptiste Oudrywere hailed for their still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in the hierarchy of painting subjects.\nT.B.D    One also finds in this period a Pre-romanticist aspect. Hubert Robert\u0026rsquo;s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect as well as the image of storms and moonlight marines by Claude Joseph Vernet. So too the change from the rational and geometricalFrench garden of André Le Nôtre to the English garden, which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature. One also finds in some of these gardens—curious ruins of temples—called \u0026ldquo;follies\u0026rdquo;.\nThe middle of the eighteenth century saw a turn to Neoclassicism in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography. This movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the artificiality and the decorative essence of the rocaille style. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is Jacques-Louis David, who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by Nicolas Poussin in the seventeenth century. Poussin and David were in turn major influences on Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Other important neoclassical painters of the period are Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Joseph-Marie Vien. Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture.\nArchitects like Ledoux and Boullée developed a radical style of neoclassical architecture based on simple and pure geometrical forms with a research of simetry and harmony, elaborating visionary projects like the complex of the Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans by Ledoux, a model of an ideal factory developed from the rational concepts of theEnlightmentthinkers.\nModern Period 19th Century The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars brought great changes to the arts in France. The program of exaltation and myth making attendant to the Emperor Napoleon I of France was closely coordinated in the paintings of David, Gros and Guérin. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingreswas the main figure of neoclassicism until the 1850s and a prominent teacher, giving priority to drawing over color. Meanwhile, Orientalism, Egyptian motifs, the tragic anti-hero, the wild landscape, the historical novel, and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance —all these elements ofRomanticism—created a vibrant period that defies easy classification. The most important romantic painter of the period was Eugène Delacroix, who had a successful public career and was the main opponent of Ingres. Before him, Théodore Géricault opened the path to romanticism with his monumental Raft of the Medusa exposed at the 1819 Salon. Camille Corot tried to escape the conventional and idealized form of landscape painting influenced by classicism to be more realist and sensible to atmospheric variations at the same time.\nT.B.D    Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century, both idealized landscape painting and Naturalism have their seeds in Romanticism. The work of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school are logical developments from it, as is the late nineteenth century Symbolism of such painters as Gustave Moreau, the professor of Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault, as well as Odilon Redon. Academic painting developed at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts was the most successful with the public and the State : highly trained painters like Jean-Léon Gérôme, William Bouguereau and Alexandre Cabanel painted historical scenes inspired by the antique, following the footsteps of Ingres and the neoclassics. Though criticized for their conventionalism by the young avant-garde painters and critics, the most talented of the Academic painters renewed the historical genre, drawing inspiration from multiple cultures and techniques, like the Orient and the new framings made possible by the invention of photography\nT.B.D    For many critics EÉdouard Manet wrote of the nineteenth century and the modern period (much as Charles Baudelaire does in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical brush strokes are the first steps toward Impressionism. Impressionism would take the Barbizon school one step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and Eugène Boudin). It led to Claude Monet with his cathedrals and haystacks, Pierre-Auguste Renoir with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, Edgar Degas with his dancers and bathers. Other important impressionists wereAlfred Sisley, Camille Pissarroand Gustave Caillebotte.\nAfter that threshold was crossed, the next thirty years became a litany of amazing experiments. Vincent van Gogh, Dutch born, but living in France, opened the road to expressionism. Georges Seurat, influenced by color theory, devised a pointillist technique that governed the Impressionist experiment and was followed by Paul Signac. Paul Cézanne, a painter\u0026rsquo;s painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent. Paul Gauguin, a banker, found symbolism in Brittany along Emile Bernard and then exoticism and primitivism in French Polynesia. Les Nabis, a movement of the 1890s, regrouping painters such as Paul Sérusier, Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard and Maurice Denis, was influenced by Gauguin\u0026rsquo;s example in Brittany : they explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a Japanese print. They preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist\u0026rsquo;s synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and symbols. Henri Rousseau, the self-taught dabbling postmaste,r became the model for the naïve revolution.\n20th Century FAMILY \u0026quot;MON\u0026quot; COLLECTED BY RUTH ASAWA, COURTESY OF STANFORD LIBRARIES.    The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by experiments in colour and content that Impressionism and Post-Impressionism had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences. At roughly the same time, Les Fauves (Henri Matisse, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Albert Marquet, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, Charles Camoin, Henri Manguin) exploded into color, much like German Expressionism. (Citation: Broude 1991Broude, Norma. Impressionism: A Feminist Reading; The Gendering of Art, Science, and Nature in the Nineteenth Century. New York: Rizzoli, 1991.)\nThe discovery of African tribal masks by Pablo Picasso, a Spaniard living in Paris, lead him to create his Les Demoiselles d\u0026rsquo;Avignon of 1907. Working independently, Picasso and Georges Braque returned to and refined Cézanne\u0026rsquo;s way of rationally comprehension of objects in a flat medium, their experiments in cubism also would lead them to integrate all aspects and objects of day-to-day life,collage of newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine, and other objects into their works. Cubism in all its phases would dominate paintings of Europe and America for the next ten years. (See the article on Cubism for a complete discussion.)\nWorld War I did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich, the Cabaret Voltaire, and created the most radical gesture possible, the anti-art of Dada. At the same time, Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp were exploring similar notions. At a 1917 art show inNew York, Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal (Fountain) signed R. Mutt as work of art, becoming the father of thereadymade.\nWhen Dada reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of Sigmund Freud, particularly by his notion of the unconscious mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage, and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.\nImmediately after this war the French art scene diverged roughly in two directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments from before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the newAbstract Expressionismand action painting from New York, executing them in a French manner using Tachism or L\u0026rsquo;art informel. Parallel to both of these tendencies, Jean Dubuffet dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, grafiti, and cartoons in a variety of media.\nThe late 1950s and early 1960s in France saw art forms that might be considered Pop Art. Yves Klein had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. Victor Vasarely invented Op-Art by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the Fluxus movement such as Ben Vautier incorporated graffiti and found objects into their work. Niki de Saint-Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. Arman gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and César Baldaccini produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their atelier populaire, produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president Charles de Gaulle.\nTHE STORY OF SAN JOSÉ\u0026rsquo;S JAPANESE COMMUNITY BY THE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ COMMISSION ON THE INTERNMENT OF LOCAL JAPANESE AMERICANS PUBLISHED ON FEBRUARY 19, 1985.

Like a bulb in the ground, she felt that she was growing and that she should be doing something every second that she was attached to this earth. Born in 1926 in Norwalk, California, a small agricultural town in Los Angeles County, she was the fourth of seven children. Her family worked in sugar beets and leased a “truck farm” in Norwalk until 1942 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order No. 9066 authorizing the internment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent during World War II. Asawa had earned praise for drawing at a young age, and continued drawing under the mentorship of professional artists in the internment camps.\nBlack Mountain College, where Asawa began experimenting with galvanized wire as an artistic medium, influenced her whole approach to making art. By the late 1950s, she established a signature abstract style working in crocheted wire and became the first Asian-American woman to earn recognition in the male-dominated field of postwar modern sculpture. Asawa and her husband Albert Lanier, an architect whom she met at Black Mountain, raised six children in San Francisco, California where she also became one of the City’s foremost advocates for arts education. The Ruth Asawa San Francisco School for the Arts is a public arts high school that grew out of her tireless campaign to support arts programming that would empower children and communities, beginning with an experimental arts workshop at Alvarado Elementary School that Asawa co-founded with art historian Sally Woodbridge in 1968.\nVIDEO COURTESY OF MASTER AND MASTERWORKS PRODUCTION, INC.

And then you put a label on it afterward. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the nice thing about what Black Mountain did for its students. They gave you permission to do anything you wanted to do. And if it didn\u0026rsquo;t fit, they\u0026rsquo;d make a category for you.\u0026rdquo;\nSimilarly, Albers taught Asawa that all materials have potential to do something that they have not yet done. By choosing a material and working with it repeatedly and with discipline, she could begin to abstract it from its historical context to discover new possibilities of form and function. Whereas, Fuller taught abstraction as an approach to playful experimentation with the materials and patterns that one sees in nature. From these teachings and her own observations of the natural world, especially early childhood memories of her family\u0026rsquo;s farm, Asawa understood that the process of abstraction required that she become background to an emerging work of art rather than force her preconceived ideas into it.\n","id":4,"title":"ABSTRACTION AT BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE","type":"entry","url":"https://ahelton897.github.io/50x50/ruth-asawa/2/"},{"content":"Asawa initially learned how to crochet with wire by visiting with basket makers in Toluca, Mexico while on a summer break from Black Mountain College in 1947.\n\nTraditionally the baskets were used to sell eggs and produce in street markets. Inspired by Albers and Fuller, Asawa began working with the material in a more abstract way, as a line that could interlock, interweave, and go anywhere in space-such that she could draw and sculpt simultaneously.\nAsawa grew her reputation in the art world in the early 1950s with a series of critically acclaimed shows featuring her crocheted wire forms at Peridot Gallery in New York City. The exposure prompted invitations to participate in annual exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art as well as the 1955 São Paulo Biennale.

She says they both had work to do and work is the thing that makes everybody live properly.\nThe Group of Architectural Works in SJMA\u0026rsquo;s collection demonstrates that Asawa and Lanier did influence one another\u0026rsquo;s thinking. When Asawa first exhibited a long-lobed wire sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1950, there was some debate about whether or not the work was sculpture because it could not stand up by itself. Neither could it be classified as a drawing, despite Asawa\u0026rsquo;s ruminations on the economy of line. The seemingly weightless airy form suspended from the ceiling of the gallery was an indefinite object that challenged and redefined those categories. Yet, the more fitting description of this type of work is architectural because Asawa created long lobes in proportion to the body and the built environment. Photographs of these works on display in private homes and offices show how they gracefully exist in the spaces they are hung, drawing attention to the form of both inner and outer space. As an architect in San Francisco, Lanier also created simple, harmonious spaces filled with natural light. Billy Bondy, who worked for him in the 1980s, remembers how, \u0026ldquo;He would tear down walls and flowingly connect the internal space of his houses with the outdoors.\u0026rdquo;\nWorking in San Francisco for more than 60 years, Asawa continued to experiment in painting, drawing, printing, tied-wire sculpture, paper-folding, casting, and public art.

His father was a builder, and his mother a homemaker. To his mother\u0026rsquo;s delight, Bischoff was quick to learn the violin as a young boy and later the piano, which he played by ear. Ultimately it was the sound and feel of the trumpet, an instrument Bischoff picked up after his service in the United States Air Force, that afforded him the most joy and inspiration throughout his life, especially jazz trumpet. It paired seamlessly with his love of expressionistic figure painting, which dissolved form into light and dealt with a kindred sort of movement.\nPainting was Bischoff\u0026rsquo;s greatest passion. He graduated from the University of California in Berkeley with a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s and master\u0026rsquo;s degree in art in 1939 and spoke of the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI; then the California School of Fine Arts), where he joined other philosophically-inclined soldiers returning from World War II, in religious terms as a \u0026ldquo;brotherhood composed of members recently liberated from a world of semidarkness.\u0026rdquo; Bischoff began to teach drawing and painting at SFAI in 1946 and had his first one-man show in 1947. But it was not until he began painting figuratively in 1952 that he achieved mythic status as the second of San Francisco\u0026rsquo;s Abstract Expressionists, after David Park, to defect from the movement\u0026rsquo;s insistence on non-representation. Curator Paul Mills immortalized Park, Bischoff, and Richard Diebenkorn as leaders of \u0026ldquo;Bay Area Figurative Painting\u0026rdquo; in a 1957 exhibition at the Oakland Museum of California (then the Oakland Art Museum). What was most desired by the Figuratives, says Bischoff, \u0026ldquo;is a condition of form which dissolves all tangible facts into intangibles of feeling.\u0026rdquo;\n","id":9,"title":"THE GRAND LYRICIST","type":"entry","url":"https://ahelton897.github.io/50x50/elmer-bischoff/1/"},{"content":"\nPaul Mills curated a definitive exhibition of Bay Area expressionistic figurative painting at the Oakland Museum of California in 1957.\n\nThe show centered around the work of three prominent painters-David Park, Elmer Bischoff, and Richard Diebenkorn-who had taught at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) and grown bored of Abstract Expressionism as a form of radical intervention following World War II. Their work was complemented by nine others working in a figurative style, including: Joseph Brooks, Theophilus Brown, Robert Downs, Bruce McGaw, Robert Qualters, Walter Snelgrove, Henry Villierme, James Weeks, and Paul Wonner.\nIn 1956, under the leadership of Gurdon Woods, figurative painting had become the new official style of SFAI. Students could paint any subject that they desired, as long as they abided by the expressionistic belief in the value of painting as process and, in the words of Bischoff, its power to \u0026ldquo;pierce through all generalities to some particular poignancy of feeling.\u0026rdquo;\nBischoff\u0026rsquo;s return to SFAI in 1956 as the head of a new graduate program positioned him as a bridge between the figurative painters who had resigned in 1952 in protest of then director Ernest Mundt\u0026rsquo;s administrative policies, namely Park and himself, and those that Bischoff recruited to join him when Woods took over, notably Diebenkorn (former faculty at SFAI who had earlier left on his own accord), Nathan Oliveira, and Frank Lobdell. SFAI fostered a second generation of figurative painters in the Bay Area that included Joan Brown and Manuel Neri.\nBISCHOFF IN STUDIO CLASS AT THE SAN FRANCISCO ART INSTITUTE, C. 1958.

Two Women in Vermillion Light, in which the branch of a tree is suspended above and in arm\u0026rsquo;s reach of two figures, presents the aliveness of an outdoor space with a warm kind of glow. The reddish orange vermillion palette is muddied by greens, browns, and blues. It is a deliberately sought-after impurity. \u0026ldquo;Indeed, some of his paintings expressed feelings of severe anxiety and dread. Several works from 1955 are so dark that the figures are barely discernable, even while depicting innocuous daylight subjects,\u0026rdquo; says Susan Landauer, a long-time colleague of Bischoff and former chief curator at the San José Museum of Art. Yet, the contrasting light of an illumined blossom and the profile of a radiant young woman give fresh vitality to this painterly scene. \u0026ldquo;Blurred into intangibility, almost to the extent that it seems an hallucination, it nonetheless remains undeniably real,\u0026rdquo; says art historian Donald Kuspit. Bischoff was intent to represent both the inner life of his figures and the physical worldly sensations that are fundamental to being human.\n","id":11,"title":"CONJURING FEELING IN COLOR AND BRUSHWORK","type":"entry","url":"https://ahelton897.github.io/50x50/elmer-bischoff/3/"},{"content":"The figurative turn in Bay Area art meant turning from the abstract expression of one\u0026rsquo;s subconscious to face the world of stimuli and draw from the model again.\n\nAt an early age, Bischoff showed an interest and aptitude for drawing. Two of his uncles did cartooning as an occasional hobby. While serving as an intelligence officer in the United States Air Force during World War II, he occasionally tried a few sketches or drawings. But the brutal violence of warfare dampened his creative drive. On his release from active duty, he returned to life drawing along with figurative painting as mediums for introspective viewing. Art historian Donald Kuspit notes that, \u0026ldquo;he frequently depicted females, as though they understand more fully what it is to be inwardly alone-as though they are more capable of introspective awareness-than men.\u0026rdquo;\nFor Bischoff, even though many of his nude models seem radically alone, a good life drawing was one that also provided its subject with an environment they could live in. He consistently participated in weekly drawing sessions and discussions with his contemporaries, to compare one another\u0026rsquo;s observations of objects in a picture plane and to explore how everything works together to form a whole. When he first joined the faculty at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) in 1946, Bischoff regularly got together with Hassel Smith and Richard Diebenkorn for vigorous drawing sessions he likened to \u0026ldquo;workouts at the gym.\u0026rdquo; When he returned to SFAI for the second time in 1956, he began attending Wednesday evening drawing sessions that Theophilus Brown, Richard Diebenkorn, David Park, and Paul Wonner had initiated with a shifting roster of artists-including SJMA artists Frank Lobdell and Joan Brown-usually at the 2571 Shattuck Avenue complex where several of them and eventually Bischoff himself had studios. In 1959, Bischoff invited Lobdell to take the place of Park in a more intimate Thursday night drawing session; Park had withdrawn because of failing health. In the late 1960s, when Bischoff began teaching at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB), he again initiated a weekly Friday breakfast meeting with Sidney Gordin and other members of the art faculty, some of who would bring work to share with the group. The group grew increasingly large, and was eventually called The Berkeley Artists Breakfast Club. Many of Bischoff\u0026rsquo;s students at UCB recall an incredible presence and stillness about him. He was incredibly supportive of their deep immersion in the relationship of the figure to its environment.\n","id":12,"title":"NEW DRAWINGS","type":"entry","url":"https://ahelton897.github.io/50x50/elmer-bischoff/4/"},{"content":"After years of acclaim for his figurative painting, in his late career Bischoff returned to explore a more immediate, relational, and abstract style.\n\nWhen he first joined the faculty at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1946, the school had been energized by war-hardened GIs and the allure of the Abstract Expressionist movement, which offered a way out of the strict disciplinary norms of the armed forces and a release of strong or repressed emotions. Then director Douglas MacAgy designed a program to encourage radical expressions of individual freedom. He allowed studios to be open twenty-four hours a day and organized raucous parties with live music by the faculty\u0026rsquo;s Studio 13 Jazz Band (Bischoff played trumpet, MacAgy played drums).\nUnder MacAgy\u0026rsquo;s tenure in the postwar era, SFAI became the beacon of Abstract Expressionism on the West Coast; although, some artists recall his wife, Jermayne MacAgy, a vanguard curator who promoted the San Francisco School at the Legion of Honor, was the more influential. During this time, Bischoff painted in a variety of abstract styles. Critic Alfred Frankenstein referred to his Surrealist-inspired paintings from 1946 as \u0026ldquo;beautifully and subtly handled studies of twirling, strutting, and flying forms.\u0026rdquo; The following year, he increased the scale of his canvases and brutalized his handling of paint with heat and speed. His criteria for good painting in the late 1940s and early 1950s was ugly rather than beautiful, and raw rather than polished. The Untitled painting in the permanent collection of the San Jose Museum of Art from Bischoff\u0026rsquo;s early period of abstraction has what he described as a \u0026ldquo;thrashing, scratching, sportive line.\u0026rdquo;\nThe appeal of abstraction for Bischoff in the late 1970s was the paring down of painting\u0026rsquo;s sensual and relational qualities. Works produced in this late period do not convey his personal emotions in as much as they convey the will of small individual images in a state of dynamic and joyful interaction bordering on anarchy. He would be delighted if the hop and energy of these late paintings were to inspire someone to dance or sing. He desired for them to have a more immediate connection with viewers than the figurative paintings that preceded this phase. The shapes, lines, and squiggles have an outward-moving willingness to participate with one another in a coherent kind of togetherness.\n","id":13,"title":"A KIND OF TOGETHERNESS","type":"entry","url":"https://ahelton897.github.io/50x50/elmer-bischoff/5/"},{"content":" Denis Diderot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_DiderotDenis Diderot (5 October 1713 – 31 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer.

Ruth Asawa insisted that the whole of her life experience was a work of art. Like a bulb in the ground, she felt that she was growing and that she should be doing something every second that she was attached to this earth. Born in 1926 in Norwalk, California, a small agricultural town in Los Angeles County, she was the fourth of seven children. Her family worked in sugar beets and leased a “truck farm” in Norwalk until 1942 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order No. 9066 authorizing the internment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent during World War II. Asawa had earned praise for drawing at a young age, and continued drawing under the mentorship of professional artists in the internment camps.\nBlack Mountain College, where Asawa began experimenting with galvanized wire as an artistic medium, influenced her whole approach to making art. By the late 1950s, she established a signature abstract style working in crocheted wire and became the first Asian-American woman to earn recognition in the male-dominated field of postwar modern sculpture. Asawa and her husband Albert Lanier, an architect whom she met at Black Mountain, raised six children in San Francisco, California where she also became one of the City’s foremost advocates for arts education. The Ruth Asawa San Francisco School for the Arts is a public arts high school that grew out of her tireless campaign to support arts programming that would empower children and communities, beginning with an experimental arts workshop at Alvarado Elementary School that Asawa co-founded with art historian Sally Woodbridge in 1968.\nVIDEO COURTESY OF MASTER AND MASTERWORKS PRODUCTION, INC.    \nVIDEO COURTESY OF MASTER AND MASTERWORKS PRODUCTION, INC.    Asawa studied at Black Mountain College for three years, from 1946 to 1948, working closely with Joseph Albers and Buckminster Fuller. She says, \u0026ldquo;Black Mountain gave you the right to do any anything you wanted to do. And then you put a label on it afterward. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the nice thing about what Black Mountain did for its students. They gave you permission to do anything you wanted to do. And if it didn\u0026rsquo;t fit, they\u0026rsquo;d make a category for you.\u0026rdquo;\nSimilarly, Albers taught Asawa that all materials have potential to do something that they have not yet done. By choosing a material and working with it repeatedly and with discipline, she could begin to abstract it from its historical context to discover new possibilities of form and function. Whereas, Fuller taught abstraction as an approach to playful experimentation with the materials and patterns that one sees in nature. From these teachings and her own observations of the natural world, especially early childhood memories of her family\u0026rsquo;s farm, Asawa understood that the process of abstraction required that she become background to an emerging work of art rather than force her preconceived ideas into it.\n\n","id":15,"title":"Ruth Asawa","type":"slider","url":"https://ahelton897.github.io/50x50/asawa/"},{"content":"TK\n","id":16,"title":"About","type":"page","url":"https://ahelton897.github.io/50x50/about/"}]
